Q3- Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript
Ans : key points after reading the diff between window, screen and document in javascript :


    Window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated as the root of the document object model. You can access it as        window.

    window.screen or just screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.

    window.document or just document is the main object of the potentially visible (or better yet: rendered) document object model/DOM.

    Since window is the global object, you can reference any properties of it with just the property name - so you do not have to write down window. - it will be figured out by the runtime.
